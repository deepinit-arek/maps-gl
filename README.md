**MapsGL** is a BSD-licensed fork of [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), which (as of Dec 8, 2020) is no longer open source.

I'd like to encourage anyone else with a stake in a healthy, open source `mapbox-gl-js` fork to join me discussing here, as we figure out where to go next. I'm more than happy to add anyone to the project with a signicifant stake in the future of `mapbox-gl-js` 1.x, I don't really want the responsibility, but I have an interest in ensuring that a healthy project takes root.
