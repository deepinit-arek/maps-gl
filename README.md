To **contribute in the early stages, [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/maps-gl/maps-gl)** or email hackerswelcome@mapsgl.org. 

Anyone with a stake in a healthy community fork is welcome to help us figure out our next steps. In the short term, we'll be very open to granting project leadership/commit privileges. When in doubt, we favour including everyone (with some github/gitlab/other reputation we can verify) affected by the license change, with the goal of minimizing fragmentation.
