**MapsGL** is a BSD-licensed fork of [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), which as of Dec 8, 2020 is no longer open source.

I'd like to encourage anyone else with a stake in a healthy, open source `mapbox-gl-js` fork to join me here, as we figure out where to go next.

I don't want the responsibility, but its important to me that a healthy project takes root, so I'm happy to add anyone to the project who wants to contribute/lead/etc!
