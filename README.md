**MapsGL** is a community fork of [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), which as of Dec 8, 2020 is no longer open source.

Anyone with a stake in a healthy community fork is welcome to contribute and discuss here. In the short term, we'll be very open in granting project leadership/commit privileges. When in doubt, we favour including everyone affected by the license change, with the goal of minimizing fragmentation.

A gitter.im (or similar... opinions?) will be coming shortly, and will be linked here.

For now, please reach out if you're interested: aloha@mapsgl.org
